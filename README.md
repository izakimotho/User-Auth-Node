# User-Auth-Node
User Auth Node
## Node.js Authentication

Implementation of node.js authentication with  login.

 
## Development

We use `node` version `10.15.0`

```
nvm install 10.15.0
```

```
nvm use 10.15.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with 

```
npm run start
```
It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:
